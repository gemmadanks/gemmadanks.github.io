Reviewing the literature is an important part of the [research process][my-research-process]. It gives you a deeper knowledge of the field and prevents you re-inventing the wheel. As part of my open research project (currently [focussed on exoplanet technosignatures][why-technosignatures]) I am documenting my review of the literature by writing summaries of important concepts and interesting papers I come across.

It is a good idea to read some historical papers when getting to know a new field. Early papers put more recent studies into context and ensure that you are not relying on citations that may or may not accurately represent previous research. There are always key references that are cited over and over again. It is also interesting to see how attitudes to different ideas change over time. 

After reading a few modern studies, I decided to refocus my efforts on some classic SETI papers to get a better grounding in how the field began. 

This post tracks the papers I and have read together with my core "to-read" list. This list is incomplete and dynamic since there will always be new citation trails to follow as I read more papers. 

For each paper I've read I include links to the publication followed by links to my notes and/or notebooks.

## Online lists of technosignature papers
- [Technosearch][technosearch] is an online tool tracking SETI papers since 1960.
- [List of SETI papers from a Penn State graduate course in SETI][penn-seti-papers]. I am planning to read as many of these as possible. A talk by [Jason Wright][jason-wright] from [Pennsylvania State University][penn-state] as part of a [technosignature seminar series][technosignatures-seminars] hosted by the [Sellers Exoplanet Environments Collaboration (SEEC)][seec] at [NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center][gsfc] gives a nice overview of SETI research and points towards the course site for further resources. There is also some nice perspectives on some of these papers by previous students there.
