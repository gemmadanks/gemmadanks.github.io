  abstract = {As it stands today, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is highly dependent on our ability to detect interesting candidate signals, or technosignatures, in radio telescope observations and distinguish these from human radio frequency interference (RFI). Current signal search pipelines look for signals in spectrograms of intensity as a function of time and frequency (which can be thought of as images), but tend to do poorly in identifying multiple signals in a single data frame. This is especially apparent when there are dim signals in the same frame as bright, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) signals. In this work, we approach this problem using convolutional neural networks (CNN) as a computationally efficient method for localizing signals in synthetic observations resembling data collected by Breakthrough Listen using the Green Bank Telescope. We generate two synthetic data sets, the first with exactly one signal at various S/N levels and the second with exactly two signals, one of which represents RFI. We find that a residual CNN with strided convolutions and using multiple image normalizations as input outperforms a more basic CNN with max pooling trained on inputs with only one normalization. Training each model on a smaller subset of the training data at higher S/N levels results in a significant increase in model performance, reducing root mean square errors by at least a factor of 3 at an S/N of 25 dB. Although each model produces outliers with significant error, these results demonstrate that using CNNs to analyze signal location is promising, especially in image frames that are crowded with multiple signals.},

While many have speculated about the character of such technosignatures, radio SETI fundamentally involves searching for signals that not only have never been detected, but also have a vast range of potential morphologies. Given that we have not yet detected a radio SETI signal, we must make assumptions about their form to develop search algorithms. The lack of positive detections also makes it difficult to test these algorithms' inherent efficacy. To address these challenges, we present Setigen, a Python-based, open-source library for heuristic-based signal synthesis and injection for both spectrograms (dynamic spectra) and raw voltage data. Setigen facilitates the production of synthetic radio observations, interfaces with standard data products used extensively by the Breakthrough Listen project (BL), and focuses on providing a physically-motivated synthesis framework compatible with real observational data and associated search methods. We discuss the core routines of Setigen and present existing and future use cases in the development and evaluation of SETI search algorithms.},

Astrobiology includes the search for extraterrestrial life via in situ exploration, spectroscopy of solar and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This review situates astrobiology within philosophical issues of the definition of life and the biological compatibility of the universe. It reviews the habitability of the Galaxy in general and of planets and moons in particular, and summarizes current controversies in origins-of-life research and in evidence for the earliest life on Earth. It critiques certain ``rare Earth'' and ``anthropic'' arguments, and considers four approaches to deciding whether intelligent life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. It concludes that astrobiology must also speak to the future of human civilization.},

Even though extraterrestrial life has not been discovered yet, the potential answer to this question has been considerably speculated about due to persistent scientific and popular interest in SETI. A main goal here is to be able to better answer this question, especially if the discovery involved the firstever technosignature, which is a sign of extraterrestrial technology such as a radio or optical signal broadcast through space. Doing so can better inform us (especially those handling the scientific confirmation and public disclosure of such a discovery) of the potential benefits and risks associated with the societal impact of the discovery. And even if a discovery has not been made yet, it can indirectly inform as to the impact of our own destiny into space. To this end, a historical and sociological approach is used, where past historical events that alleged the discovery of extraterrestrial life (events such as inconclusive scientific discoveries and science fiction stories) are used as an analogy. In conjunction with this, a model of the societal impact of discovering the first confirmed technosignature is presented, based on a process representing the discovery's hypothetical diffusion into society. This is so as to understand what the extent of the impact can be of an actual discovery.},

  abstract = {There have been periodic efforts in recent decades to search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), especially by trying to find an extraterrestrial (ET) radio signal or other technosignature in space. Yet, no such technosignatures have been found. Considering the vastness of space, finding such technosignatures has been described as trying to find a needle in a cosmic haystack. To help resolve this, two hypotheses are proposed to aid SETI researchers in narrowing the search for ET technosignatures, based on a network analysis approach to locate where in space potential ET communication networks would most likely be. A potential ET communication network can use exoplanets as communication access points (e.g., placing a communication satellite into a planet's orbit, and/or an antenna on a planet's surface). The approach uses a topology where exoplanets are represented as nodes, and the lines of average distance (generalized communication paths) between adjacent exoplanets are represented as edges; the nodes and edges form local and wide planetary networks. Using the approach and data visualization on exoplanet databases can highlight locations of potential ET communication networks in space; an example is provided based on a NenuFAR radio telescope SETI project. The first hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely appear in a potentially habitable solar system containing a high concentration of planets, wherein the planets function as communication access points to facilitate a potential ET communication network. The second hypothesis posits that an ET technosignature would more likely appear in a highly concentrated cluster of potentially habitable solar systems. Contributions to the SETI field can be increased accuracy in finding ET technosignatures, increased accuracy in reaching a Schelling Point (a mutual realization of how we and an ET intelligence can find each other), and promoting interdisciplinary SETI research.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for studying generic behaviors possible in the interaction between a resource-harvesting technological civilization (an exo-civilization) and the planetary environment in which it evolves. Using methods from dynamical systems theory, we introduce and analyze a suite of simple equations modeling a population which consumes resources for the purpose of running a technological civilization and the feedback those resources drive on the state of the host planet. The feedbacks can drive the planet away from the initial state the civilization originated in and into domains that are detrimental to its sustainability. Our models conceptualize the problem primarily in terms of feedbacks from the resource use onto the coupled planetary systems. In addition, we also model the population growth advantages gained via the harvesting of these resources. We present three models of increasing complexity: (1) Civilization-planetary interaction with a single resource; (2) Civilization-planetary interaction with two resources each of which has a different level of planetary system feedback; (3) Civilization-planetary interaction with two resources and nonlinear planetary feedback (i.e., runaways). All three models show distinct classes of exo-civilization trajectories. We find smooth entries into long-term, ``sustainable'' steady states. We also find population booms followed by various levels of ``die-off.'' Finally, we also observe rapid ``collapse'' trajectories for which the population approaches n\,=\,0. Our results are part of a program for developing an ``Astrobiology of the Anthropocene'' in which questions of sustainability, centered on the coupled Earth-system, can be seen in their proper astronomical/planetary context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for both the coupled Earth system and for the consideration of exo-civilizations across cosmic history.

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical data bases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large data sets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence light curves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence light curves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behaviour in Boyajian's star; we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artefacts. By identifying {$<$}4 per cent of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

In this context, we present here a first attempt to detect optical messages emitted from the solar system to the ecliptic star Wolf 359, the thirdnearest stellar system, based on observations gathered by the TRAPPIST-South and SPECULOOS-South robotic telescopes. While sensitive enough to detect constant emission with emitting power as small as a few watts, this search led to a null result. We note that the putative alien probes could be emitting ``off-axis'' and be located much closer to the Sun than the start of the ``solar gravitational line'' at 550 au. We performed a search for such an offaxis emitter in our data, whose result turned out negative too.},

Here, we introduce other indicators than Drake's number ND to develop a demography of artificial emissions populating the Galaxy. We focus on three main categories of statistically independent signals (isotropic, narrow beams, and rotating beacons) to calculate the average number NG of emission processes present in the Galaxy and the average number of them crossing Earth, \$\textbackslash bar\{k\}\$, which is a quantity amenable to statistical estimation from direct observations. We show that \$\textbackslash bar\{k\}\$ coincides with ND only for isotropic emissions, while \$\textbackslash bar\{k\}\$ can be orders of magnitude smaller than ND in the case of highly directional signals. We further show that while ND gives the number of emissions being released at the present time, NG considers also the signals from no longer active emitters but whose emissions still occupy the Galaxy. We find that as long as the average longevity of the emissions is shorter than about 105\,yr, NG is fully determined by the rate of emissions alone, in contrast to ND and \$\textbackslash bar\{k\}\$ which depend also on the emission longevity. Finally, using analytic formulas of NG, ND, and \$\textbackslash bar\{k\}\$ determined for each type of emission processes here considered, we provide a comprehensive overview of the values these quantities can possibly achieve as functions of the emission birthrates, longevities, and directionality.},

We show that the physical barrier to interstellar travel can be greatly reduced if voyagers are patient, and wait for the close passage of another star. For a representative time of {$\sim$}1 Gyr, characteristic of the remaining time that Earth will remain habitable, one anticipates a passage of another star within {$\sim$}1500 au. This lowers the travel time for interstellar migration by {$\sim$}two orders of magnitude compared with calculated travel times based on distances comparable to average interstellar separations (i.e., {$\sim$}1 pc) in the solar vicinity. We consider the implications for how long-lived civilizations may respond to stellar evolution, including the case of stars in wide binaries, and the difficulties of identifying systems currently undergoing a relevant close encounter. Assuming that life originates only around G-type stars, but migrates primarily to lower mass hosts when the original system becomes uninhabitable, the fraction of extant technological civilizations that exist as diaspora can be comparable to the fraction that still orbit their original host stars.},

  abstract = {The Astro2020 report outlines numerous recommendations that could significantly advance technosignature science. Technosignatures refer to any observable manifestations of extraterrestrial technology, and the search for technosignatures is part of the continuum of the astrobiological search for biosignatures. The search for technosignatures is directly relevant to the "World and Suns in Context" theme and "Pathways to Habitable Worlds" program in the Astro2020 report. The relevance of technosignatures was explicitly mentioned in "E1 Report of the Panel on Exoplanets, Astrobiology, and the Solar System," which stated that "life's global impacts on a planet's atmosphere, surface, and temporal behavior may therefore manifest as potentially detectable exoplanet biosignatures, or technosignatures" and that potential technosignatures, much like biosignatures, must be carefully analyzed to mitigate false positives. The connection of technosignatures to this high-level theme and program can be emphasized, as the report makes clear the purpose is to address the question "Are we alone?" This question is also presented in the Explore Science 2020-2024 plan as a driver of NASA's mission. This white paper summarizes the potential technosignature opportunities within the recommendations of the Astro2020 report, should they be implemented by funding agencies. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the relevance of technosignature science to a wide range of missions and urge the scientific community to include the search for technosignatures as part of the stated science justifications for the large and medium programs that include the Infrared/Optical/Ultraviolet space telescope, Extremely Large Telescopes, probe-class far-infrared and X-ray missions, and various facilities in radio astronomy.},

Most previous searches for technosignatures have focused on searches for radio signals, but many current and future observing facilities could also constrain the prevalence of some non-radio technosignatures. This search could thus benefit from broader participation by the astronomical community, as contributions to technosignature science can also take the form of negative results that provide statistically meaningful quantitative upper limits on the presence of a signal. This paper provides a synthesis of the recommendations of the 2020 TechnoClimes workshop, which was an online event intended to develop a research agenda to prioritize and guide future theoretical and observational studies technosignatures. The paper provides a high-level overview of the use of current and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at ultraviolet, optical, or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on the detectability of atmospheric technosignatures, artificial surface modifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and interstellar flight. This overview does not derive any new quantitative detection limits but is intended to provide additional science justification for the use of current and planned observing facilities as well as to inspire astronomers conducting such observations to consider the relevance of their ongoing observations to technosignature science. This synthesis also identifies possible technology gaps with the ability of current and planned missions to search for technosignatures, which suggests the need to consider technosignature science cases in the design of future mission concepts.},

  abstract = {We apply classical machine vision and machine deep learning methods to prototype signal classifiers for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Our novel approach uses two-dimensional spectrograms of measured and simulated radio signals bearing the imprint of a technological origin. The studies are performed using archived narrow-band signal data captured from real-time SETI observations with the Allen Telescope Array and a set of digitally simulated signals designed to mimic real observed signals. By treating the 2D spectrogram as an image, we show that high quality parametric and non-parametric classifiers based on automated visual analysis can achieve high levels of discrimination and accuracy, as well as low false-positive rates. The (real) archived data were subjected to numerous feature-extraction algorithms based on the vertical and horizontal image moments and Huff transforms to simulate feature rotation. The most successful algorithm used a two-step process where the image was first filtered with a rotation, scale and shift-invariant affine transform followed by a simple correlation with a previously defined set of labeled prototype examples. The real data often contained multiple signals and signal ghosts, so we performed our non-parametric evaluation using a simpler and more controlled dataset produced by simulation of complex-valued voltage data with properties similar to the observed prototypes. The most successful non-parametric classifier employed a wide residual (convolutional) neural network based on pre-existing classifiers in current use for object detection in ordinary photographs. These results are relevant to a wide variety of research domains that already employ spectrogram analysis from time-domain astronomy to observations of earthquakes to animal vocalization analysis.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, astronomers have detected thousands of planets and candidate planets by observing their periodic transits in front of their host stars. A related method, called transit spectroscopy, might soon allow studies of the chemical imprints of life in extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Here, we address the reciprocal question, namely, from where is Earth detectable by extrasolar observers using similar methods. We explore Earth's transit zone (ETZ), the projection of a band around Earth's ecliptic onto the celestial plane, where observers can detect Earth transits across the Sun. ETZ is between 0.520\textdegree{} and 0.537\textdegree{} wide due to the noncircular Earth orbit. The restricted Earth transit zone (rETZ), where Earth transits the Sun less than 0.5 solar radii from its center, is about 0.262\textdegree{} wide. We first compile a target list of 45 K and 37 G dwarf stars inside the rETZ and within 1\,kpc (about 3260 light-years) using the Hipparcos catalogue. We then greatly enlarge the number of potential targets by constructing an analytic galactic disk model and find that about 105 K and G dwarf stars should reside within the rETZ. The ongoing Gaia space mission can potentially discover all G dwarfs among them (several 104) within the next 5 years. Many more potentially habitable planets orbit dim, unknown M stars in ETZ and other stars that traversed ETZ thousands of years ago. If any of these planets host intelligent observers, they could have identified Earth as a habitable, or even as a living, world long ago, and we could be receiving their broadcasts today. The K2 mission, the Allen Telescope Array, the upcoming Square Kilometer Array, or the Green Bank Telescope might detect such deliberate extraterrestrial messages. Ultimately, ETZ would be an ideal region to be monitored by the Breakthrough Listen Initiatives, an upcoming survey that will constitute the most comprehensive search for extraterrestrial intelligence so far.

The observing frequency was corrected both for motions with respect to three astronomical inertial frames, and for the effect of Earth's rotation, which provides a characteristic changing Doppler signature for narrow-band signals of extraterrestrial origin. Among the 6 \texttimes{} 1013 spectral channels searched, we have found 37 candidate events exceeding the average detection threshold of 1.7 \texttimes{} 10-23 W m-2, none of which has been detected upon reobservation. The strongest of these appear to be dominated by rare processor errors. However, the strongest signals that survive culling for terrestrial interference lie in or near the Galactic plane. We describe the search and candidate events, and set limits on the prevalence of supercivilizations transmitting Doppler-precompensated beacons at H I or its second harmonic. We conclude with recommendations for future searches, based upon these findings, and a description of our next-generation search system.},

  abstract = {The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is a scientific and cultural effort seeking evidence of intelligent life beyond earth. Radio SETI observes the radio spectrum for ``technosignatures'' that could be produced by an advanced ET society. This work models radio SETI as an end-to-end system and focuses on narrowband intentional transmissions. We look at strategies to maximize the expected number of detections per year (DPY) of search. Assuming that ET civilizations will be associated with star systems, we want to maximize the number of stars that may be observed at one time. Assuming a representative star density, this requires maximizing the search volume in a cone defined by the detection range and field of view (FOV). The parameter trades are modified from the case where one simply maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, a joint optimization between FOV and sensitivity is needed. Some implications: (1) Instead of focusing on the terrestrial microwave window of 1\textendash 10 GHz, frequencies below 1 GHz may be optimal for detection rate due to the larger FOV. (2) Arrays of smaller dishes should be favored compared to a single dish of equivalent area. (3) Aperture arrays are desirable due to their large potential FOV. Many radio telescopes under development will provide both high sensitivity and large FOV, and should offer much improved SETI detection rates. Still higher DPY is needed, however, to achieve results in reasonable time horizons, which should be possible by greatly expanding computation capability to the next-generation wide-FOV antenna arrays.},

We add a list of 1649 stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog that span the Hertzprung-Russell diagram, including all spectral types along the main sequence, subgiants, and giant stars. This sample offers diversity and inclusion of all stellar types, but with thoughtful limits and due attention to main sequence stars. Our targets also include 123 nearby galaxies composed of a "morphological-type-complete" sample of the nearest spirals, ellipticals, dwarf spherioidals, and irregulars. While their great distances hamper the detection of technological electromagnetic radiation, galaxies offer the opportunity to observe billions of stars simultaneously and to sample the bright end of the technological luminosity function.

First results suggest that it is teeming with a fascinating diversity of rocky planets, including those in the habitable zone. Even our closest star, Proxima Centauri, harbors a small planet in its habitable zone, Proxima b. With the next generation of telescopes, we will be able to peer into the atmospheres of rocky planets and get a glimpse into other worlds. Using our own planet and its wide range of biota as a Rosetta stone, we explore how we could detect habitability and signs of life on exoplanets over interstellar distances. Current telescopes are not yet powerful enough to characterize habitable exoplanets, but the next generation of telescopes that is already being built will have the capabilities to characterize close-by habitable worlds. The discussion on what makes a planet a habitat and how to detect signs of life is lively. This review will show the latest results, the challenges of how to identify and characterize such habitable worlds, and how near-future telescopes will revolutionize the field. For the first time in human history, we have developed the technology to detect potential habitable worlds. Finding thousands of exoplanets has taken the field of comparative planetology beyond the Solar System.},

Spectroscopic observations of transits and eclipses are the most commonly used tool to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and will be used in the search for life. However, an exoplanet's orbit must be aligned with our line of sight to observe a transit. Here we ask, from which stellar vantage points would a distant observer be able to search for life on Earth in the same way? We use the TESS Input Catalog and data from Gaia DR2 to identify the closest stars that could see Earth as a transiting exoplanet: We identify 1,004 Main Sequence stars within 100 parsecs, of which 508 guarantee a minimum 10-hour long observation of Earth's transit. Our star list consists of about 77\% M-type, 12\% K-type, 6\% G-type, 4\% F-type stars, and 1\% A-type stars close to the ecliptic. SETI searches like the Breakthrough Listen Initiative are already focusing on this part of the sky. Our catalog now provides a target list for this search. As part of the extended mission, NASA's TESS will also search for transiting planets in the ecliptic to find planets that could detect life on our transiting Earth as well.},

  abstract = {Uncovering the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets within the habitable zone (HZ) of their host stars has been a particular focus of exoplanetary science in recent years. The statistics of these occurrence rates have largely been derived from transiting planet discoveries, and have uncovered numerous HZ planets in compact systems around M-dwarf host stars. Here we explore the width of the HZ as a function of spectral type, and the dynamical constraints on the number of stable orbits within the HZ for a given star. We show that, although the Hill radius for a given planetary mass increases with larger semimajor axis, the width of the HZ for earlier-type stars allows for more terrestrial planets in the HZ than late-type stars. In general, dynamical constraints allow {$\sim$}6 HZ Earth-mass planets for stellar masses 0.7Me, depending on the presence of farther out giant planets. As an example, we consider the case of Beta CVn, a nearby bright solar-type star. We present 20 yr of radial velocities (RV) from the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and Automated Planet Finder (APF) instruments and conduct an injection-recovery analysis of planetary signatures in the data. Our analysis of these RV data rule out planets more massive than Saturn within 10 au of the star. These system properties are used to calculate the potential dynamical packing of terrestrial planets in the HZ and show that such nearby stellar targets could be particularly lucrative for HZ planet detection by direct imaging exoplanet missions.},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Giant planets have now been discovered around other stars, and it is only a matter of time until Earth-sized planets are detected. Whether any of these planets are suitable for life depends on their volatile abundances, especially water, and on their climates. Only planets within the liquid-water habitable zone (HZ) can support life on their surfaces and, thus, can be analyzed remotely to determine whether they are inhabited. Fortunately, current models predict that HZs are relatively wide around main-sequence stars not too different from our sun. This conclusion is based on studies of how our own planet has evolved over time. Earth's climate has remained conducive to life for the past 3.5 billion years or more, despite a large increase in solar luminosity, probably because of previous higher concentrations of CO               2               and/or CH               4               . Both these gases are involved in negative feedback loops that help to stabilize the climate.

  abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on Earth today has biogenic and anthropogenic sources. During the Covid-19 pandemic, observations of global NO2 emissions have shown a significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon this example of NO2 as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO2 as an atmospheric technosignature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf, and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO2 concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars because there are fewer short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO2. In cloud-free results, present Earth-level NO2 on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10 pc can be detected with signal-to-noise ratio {$\sim$}5 within {$\sim$}400 hr with a 15 m LUVOIR-like telescope when observed in the 0.2\textendash 0.7 {$\mu$}m range where NO2 has a strong absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could mimic the NO2 feature. Historically, global NO2 levels were 3\texttimes{} higher, indicating the capability of detecting a civilization at the stage where Earth's civilization was 40 yr ago. Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral signatures of NO2 on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several hundred hours of observation time, both due to weaker NO2 absorption in this region and because of masking features by dominant H2O and CO2 bands in the infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at these levels could be used to place upper limits on the prevalence of NO2 as a technosignature.},

Several reasons for pursuing a broad program are given, including increasing the chance of a positive result in SETI, commensal astrophysics, and characterizing systematics. The Exotica Catalog is a 963 entry collection of 816 distinct targets intended to include ``one of everything'' in astronomy. It contains four samples: the Prototype sample, with an archetype of every known major type of nontransient celestial object; the Superlative sample of objects, with the most extreme properties; the Anomaly sample of enigmatic targets that are in some way unexplained; and the Control sample, with sources not expected to produce positive results. As far as we are aware, this is the first object list in recent times with the purpose of spanning the breadth of astrophysics. We share it with the community in hopes that it can guide treasury surveys and as a general reference work. Accompanying the catalog is an extensive discussion of the classification of objects and a new classification system for anomalies. Extensive notes on the objects in the catalog are available online. We discuss how we intend to proceed with observations in the catalog, contrast it with our extant Exotica efforts, and suggest how similar tactics may be applied to other programs.},

  abstract = {In 2019, Reyes \& Wright used the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) to initiate a comprehensive bibliography for SETI accessible to the public. Since then, updates to the library have been incomplete, partly due to the difficulty in managing the large number of false positive publications generated by searching ADS using simple search terms. In preparation for a recent update, the scope of the library was revised and reexamined. The scope now includes social sciences and commensal SETI. Results were curated based on five SETI keyword searches: "SETI", "technosignature", "Fermi Paradox," "Drake Equation", and "extraterrestrial intelligence." These keywords returned 553 publications that merited inclusion in the bibliography that were not previously present. A curated library of false positive results is now concurrently maintained to facilitate their exclusion from future searches. A search query and workflow was developed to capture nearly all SETI-related papers indexed by ADS while minimizing false positives. These tools will enable efficient, consistent updates of the SETI library by future curators, and could be adopted for other bibliography projects as well.},

  abstract = {Breakthrough Listen is the most comprehensive and sensitive search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to date, employing a collection of international observational facilities including both radio and optical telescopes. During the first three years of the Listen program, thousands of targets have been observed with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), Parkes Telescope and Automated Planet Finder. At GBT and Parkes, observations have been performed ranging from 700 MHz to 26 GHz, with raw data volumes averaging over 1PB / day. A pseudo-real time software spectroscopy suite is used to produce multi-resolution spectrograms amounting to approximately 400 GB hr\^-1 GHz\^-1 beam\^-1. For certain targets, raw baseband voltage data is also preserved. Observations with the Automated Planet Finder produce both 2-dimensional and 1-dimensional high resolution (R\textasciitilde 10\^5) echelle spectral data. Although the primary purpose of Listen data acquisition is for SETI, a range of secondary science has also been performed with these data, including studies of fast radio bursts. Other current and potential research topics include spectral line studies, searches for certain kinds of dark matter, probes of interstellar scattering, pulsar searches, radio transient searches and investigations of stellar activity. Listen data are also being used in the development of algorithms, including machine learning approaches to modulation scheme classification and outlier detection, that have wide applicability not just for astronomical research but for a broad range of science and engineering. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software pipeline used for collection, reduction, archival, and public dissemination of Listen data. We describe the data formats and tools, and present Breakthrough Listen Data Release 1.0 (BLDR 1.0), a defined set of publicly-available raw and reduced data totalling 1 PB.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The Doppler shift of a radio signal is caused by the relative motion between the transmitter and receiver. The change in frequency of the signal over time is called the drift rate. In the studies of radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), extraterrestrial narrowband signals are expected to appear ``chirped'' since both the exoplanet and Earth are moving. Such planet rotation and orbital revolution around the central star can cause a nonzero drift rate. Other relative motions between the transmitter and receiver, such as the gravitational redshift and galactic potential, are negligible. In this paper, we mainly consider the common cases in which the drift rate is contributed by the rotations and orbits of Earth and the exoplanet in the celestial mechanics perspective, and we briefly discuss other cases different from the Earth\textendash exoplanet one. We can obtain the expected pseudosinusoidal drifting result with long-term observations and shorter orbital periods of exoplanets. Exoplanets with higher orbital eccentricities can cause asymmetric drifting. The expected result should be intermittent pseudosinusoidal curves in long-term observations. The characteristics of pseudosinusoidal curves, as another new criterion for extraterrestrial signals, can be applied to long-term SETI reobservations in future research.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The discovery of ubiquitous habitable extrasolar planets, combined with revolutionary advances in instrumentation and observational capabilities, has ushered in a renaissance in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Large scale SETI activities are now underway at numerous international facilities. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is the largest single-aperture radio telescope in the world, and is well positioned to conduct sensitive searches for radio emission indicative of exo-intelligence. SETI is one of the five key science goals specified in the original FAST project plan. A collaboration with the Breakthrough Listen Initiative was initiated in 2016 with a joint statement signed both by Dr. Jun Yan, the then director of National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), and Dr. Peter Worden, Chairman of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation. In this paper, we highlight some of the unique features of FAST that will allow for novel SETI observations. We identify and describe three different signal types indicative of a technological source, namely, narrow band, wide-band artificially dispersed and modulated signals. Here, we propose observations with FAST to achieve sensitivities never before explored. For nearby exoplanets, such as TESS targets, FAST will be sensitive to an EIRP of 1.9 \texttimes{} 1011 W, well within the reach of current human technology. For the Andromeda Galaxy, FAST will be able to detect any Kardashev type II or more advanced civilization there.},

An integral component of the project is the design and implementation of wide-bandwidth data recorder and signal processing systems. The capabilities of these systems, particularly at radio frequencies, directly determine survey speed; further, given a fixed observing time and spectral coverage, they determine sensitivity as well. Here, we detail the Breakthrough Listen wide-bandwidth data recording system deployed at the 100 m aperture Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. The system digitizes up to 6 GHz of bandwidth at 8 bits for both polarizations, storing the resultant 24 GB s-1 of data to disk. This system is among the highest data rate baseband recording systems in use in radio astronomy. A future system expansion will double recording capacity, to achieve a total Nyquist bandwidth of 12 GHz in two polarizations.

One theorized technosignature are narrowband Doppler drifting radio signals. The principal challenge in conducting SETI in the radio domain is developing a generalized technique to reject human radio frequency interference (RFI) that dominate the features across the band in searches for technosignatures. Here, we present the first comprehensive deep-learning based technosignature search to date, returning 8 promising ETI signals-of-interest for re-observation as part of the Breakthrough Listen initiative. The search comprises 820 unique targets observed with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, totaling over 480 hr of on-sky data. We implement a novel {$\beta$} -Convolutional Variational Autoencoder with an embedded discriminator combined with Random Forest Decision Trees to classify technosignature candidates in a semi-unsupervised manner. We compare our results with prior classical techniques on the same dataset and conclude that our algorithm returns more convincing and novel signals-of-interest with a manageable false positive rate. This new approach presents itself as a leading solution in accelerating SETI and other transient research into the age of data-driven astronomy.},

These observations focused on regions surrounding 31 Sun-like stars near the plane of the Galaxy. We present the results of our search for narrowband signals in this data set, as well as improvements to our data processing pipeline. Specifically, we applied an improved candidate signal detection procedure that relies on the topographic prominence of the signal power, which nearly doubles the signal detection count of some previously analyzed data sets. We also improved the direction-of-origin filters that remove most radio frequency interference (RFI) to ensure that they uniquely link signals observed in separate scans. We performed a preliminary signal injection and recovery analysis to test the performance of our pipeline. We found that our pipeline recovers 93\% of the injected signals over the usable frequency range of the receiver and 98\% if we exclude regions with dense RFI. In this analysis, 99.73\% of the recovered signals were correctly classified as technosignature candidates. Our improved data processing pipeline classified over 99.84\% of the {$\sim$}26 million signals detected in our data as RFI. Of the remaining candidates, 4539 were detected outside of known RFI frequency regions. The remaining candidates were visually inspected and verified to be of anthropogenic nature. Our search compares favorably to other recent searches in terms of end-to-end sensitivity, frequency drift rate coverage, and signal detection count per unit bandwidth per unit integration time.},

Using straightforward calculations, VH75 predicted the ``doomsday'' years for these scenarios ({$\approx$}2020\textendash 2050), when we as a species should run out of space or food, or induce catastrophic anthropogenic climate change through thermodynamically unavoidable direct heating of the planet. Now that over four decades have passed, in this paper we update VH75. We perform similar calculations as that work, with improved data and trends in population growth, food production, energy use, and climate change. For many of the impacts noted in VH75 our work amounts to pushing the ``doomsday'' horizon back to the 2300\,s\textendash 2400\,s (or much further for population-driven interstellar colonization). This is largely attributable to using worldwide data that exhibit smaller growth rates of population and energy use in the last few decades. While population-related catastrophes appear less likely than in VH75, our continued growth in energy use provides insight into possible future issues. We find that, if historic trends continue, direct heating of the Earth will be a substantial contributor to climate change by {$\approx$}2260, regardless of the energy source used, coincident with our transition to a Kardashev type-I civilization. We also determine that either an increase of Earth's global mean temperature of {$\approx$}12\,K will occur or an unreasonably high fraction of the planet will need to be covered by solar collectors by {$\sim$}2400 to keep pace with our growth in energy use. We further discuss the implications in terms of interstellar expansion, the transition to type II and III civilizations, SETI, and the Fermi Paradox. We conclude that the ``sustainability solution'' to the Fermi Paradox is a compelling possibility.},

  abstract = {Radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation remains a major challenge in the search for radio technosignatures. Typical mitigation strategies include a direction-of-origin (DoO) filter, where a signal is classified as RFI if it is detected in multiple directions on the sky. These classifications generally rely on estimates of signal properties, such as frequency and frequency drift rate. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer a promising complement to existing filters because they can be trained to analyze dynamic spectra directly, instead of relying on inferred signal properties. In this work, we compiled several data sets consisting of labeled pairs of images of dynamic spectra, and we designed and trained a CNN that can determine whether or not a signal detected in one scan is also present in another scan. This CNN-based DoO filter outperforms both a baseline 2D correlation model as well as existing DoO filters over a range of metrics, with precision and recall values of 99.15\% and 97.81\%, respectively. We found that the CNN reduces the number of signals requiring visual inspection after the application of traditional DoO filters by a factor of 6-16 in nominal situations.},

We present the results of our search for narrowband signals in this data set with techniques that are generally similar to those described by Margot et al. Our improved data processing pipeline classified over 98\% of the approximately six million detected signals as anthropogenic radio frequency interference (RFI). Of the remaining candidates, 30 were detected outside of densely populated frequency regions attributable to RFI. These candidates were carefully examined and determined to be of terrestrial origin. We discuss the problems associated with the common practice of ignoring frequency space around candidate detections in radio technosignature detection pipelines. These problems include inaccurate estimates of figures of merit and unreliable upper limits on the prevalence of technosignatures. We present an algorithm that mitigates these problems and improves the efficiency of the search. Specifically, our new algorithm increases the number of candidate detections by a factor of more than four compared to the results of Margot et al.},

A core part of the BL program is a comprehensive survey of 1702 nearby stars at radio wavelengths (1-10 GHz). Here, we report on observations with the 64-m CSIRO Parkes radio telescope in New South Wales, Australia, and the 100-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia, USA. Over 2016 January to 2019 March, a sample of 1138 stars was observed at Green Bank using the 1.10-1.90 GHz and 1.80-2.80 GHz receivers, and 189 stars were observed with Parkes over 2.60-3.45 GHz. We searched these data for the presence of engineered signals with Doppler-acceleration drift rates between -4 to 4 Hz/s. Here, we detail our data analysis techniques and provide examples of detected events. After excluding events with characteristics consistent with terrestrial radio interference, we are left with zero candidates. Given the sensitivity of our observations, we can put an upper limit on the power of potential radio transmitters at these frequencies at 2x10\^12 W, and 9x10\^12 W for GBT and Parkes respectively. These observations constitute the most comprehensive search over 1.10-3.45 GHz for technosignatures to date.

On 2019 April 29, the Breakthrough Listen SETI project observed Proxima Centauri with the Parkes `Murriyang' radio telescope. These data contained a narrowband signal with characteristics broadly consistent with a technosignature near 982\,MHz (`blc1'). Here we present a procedure for the analysis of potential technosignatures, in the context of the ubiquity of human-generated radio interference, which we apply to blc1. Using this procedure, we find that blc1 is not an extraterrestrial technosignature, but rather an electronically drifting intermodulation product of local, time-varying interferers aligned with the observing cadence. We find dozens of instances of radio interference with similar morphologies to blc1 at frequencies harmonically related to common clock oscillators. These complex intermodulation products highlight the necessity for detailed follow-up of any signal of interest using a procedure such as the one outlined in this work. A radio signal detected in the direction of Proxima Centauri in a Breakthrough Listen programme is analysed for signs that it was transmitted by extraterrestrial intelligent life, using a newly developed framework. However, the signal `blc1' is likely to be terrestrial radio-frequency interference.},

  abstract = {We report on a search for artificial narrowband signals of 20 stars within the restricted Earth Transit Zone as a part of the ten-year Breakthrough Listen (BL) search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The restricted Earth Transit Zone is the region of the sky from which an observer would see the Earth transit the Sun with an impact parameter of less than 0.5. This region of the sky is geometrically unique, providing a potential way for an extraterrestrial intelligence to discover the Solar System. The targets were nearby (7-143 pc) and the search covered an electromagnetic frequency range of 3.95-8.00 GHz. We used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to perform these observations with the standard BL data recorder. We searched these data for artificial narrowband (\$\textbackslash sim\$Hz) signals with Doppler drift rates of \$\textbackslash pm 20\$ Hz s\$\^\{-1\}\$. We found one set of potential candidate signals on the target HIP 109656 which was then found to be consistent with known properties of anthropogenic radio frequency interference. We find no evidence for radio technosignatures from extraterrestrial intelligence in our observations. The observing campaign achieved a minimum detectable flux which would have allowed detections of emissions that were \$10\^\{-3\}\$ to \$0.88\$ times as powerful as the signaling capability of the Arecibo radar transmitter, for the nearest and furthest stars respectively. We conclude that at least \$8\textbackslash\%\$ of the systems in the restricted Earth Transit Zone within 150 pc do not possess the type of transmitters searched in this survey. To our knowledge, this is the first targeted search for extraterrestrial intelligence of the restricted Earth Transit Zone.

  abstract = {A radio transmitter that is accelerating with a non-zero radial component with respect to a receiver will produce a signal that appears to change its frequency over time. This effect, commonly produced in astrophysical situations where orbital and rotational motions are ubiquitous, is called a drift rate. In radio SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) research, it is unknown a priori which frequency a signal is being sent at, or even if there will be any drift rate at all besides motions within the solar system. Therefore drift rates across the potential range need to be individually searched and a maximum drift rate needs to be chosen. The middle of this range is zero, indicating no acceleration, but the absolute value for the limits remains unconstrained. A balance must be struck between computational time and the possibility of excluding a signal from an ETI. In this work, we examine physical considerations that constrain a maximum drift rate and highlight the importance of this problem in any narrowband SETI search. We determine that a normalized drift rate of 200 nHz (e.g., 200 Hz s -1 at 1 GHz) is a generous, physically motivated guideline for the maximum drift rate that should be applied to future narrowband SETI projects if computational capabilities permit.},

We introduce a novel framework to analyze a broad diversity of TS in a quantitative manner.

A decision tree of possible search strategies is presented as well as a brief history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) projects since 1960. The characteristics of 14 SETI projects currently operating on telescopes are discussed and compared using one of many possible figures of merit. Plans for SETI searches in the immediate and more distant future are outlined. Plans for success, the significance of null results, and some opinions on deliberate transmission of signals (as well as listening) are also included. SETI results to date are negative, but in reality, not much searching has yet been done.},

Well over 100 search programs have been conducted since that time, primarily at radio and optical wavelengths, (see www.seti.org/searcharchives) without any successful signal detection. Some have suggested that this means humans are alone in the cosmos. But that is far too strong a conclusion to draw from far too small an observational sampling. Instead of concluding that intelligent life on Earth is unique, it is more appropriate to note that in 50 years our ability to search for electromagnetic signals has improved by at least 14 orders of magnitude and that these improvements are still occurring at an exponential rate. At the SETI Institute we are in the process of reinventing the way we search in order to fully utilize these technological enhancements. We are now building the setiQuest community and we intend to get the world involved in making our searches better. We need to find ways to harness the intelligence of all Earthlings in order to better seek out extraterrestrial intelligence. If we do it right, we just might succeed, and we might also change how we see ourselves, and make our own world a better place.},

In this work, we extend the Breakthrough Listen (BL) search for extraterrestrial intelligence to include targeted searches of stars identified by TESS as potential exoplanet hosts. We report on 113 30-min cadence observations collected for 28 targets selected from the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) from among those identified as containing signatures of transiting planets. The targets were searched for narrowband signals from 1-11 GHz using the turboSETI pipeline architecture modified for compatibility with the Google Cloud environment. Data were searched for drift rates of +/-4 Hz/s above a minimum signal-to-noise threshold of 10, following the parameters of previous searches conducted by Price et al. (2020) and Enriquez et al. (2017). The observations presented in this work establish some of the deepest limits to date over such a wide band (1-11 GHz) for life beyond Earth. We determine that fewer than 12.72\% of the observed targets possess transmitters operating at these frequencies with an Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) greater than our derived threshold of 4.9*10\^(14) W.},

If the Sun is part of such a network, there should be probes at the gravitational foci of nearby stars. If there are probes within the solar system connected to such a network, we might detect them by intercepting transmissions from relays at these foci. Here, we demonstrate a search across a wide bandwidth for interstellar communication relays beyond the Sun's innermost gravitational focus at 550 au using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Breakthrough Listen (BL) backend. As a first target, we searched for a relay at the focus of the Alpha Centauri AB system while correcting for the parallax due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. We searched for radio signals directed at the inner solar system from such a source in the L and S bands. Our analysis, utilizing the turboSETI software developed by BL, did not detect any signal indicative of a non-human-made artificial origin. Further analysis excluded false negatives and signals from the nearby target HD 13908. Assuming a conservative gain of 103 in the L band and roughly 4 times that in the S band, a {$\sim$}1 m directed transmitter would be detectable by our search above 7 W at 550 au or 23 W at 1000 au in the L band, and above 2 W at 550 au or 7 W at 1000 au in the S band. Finally, we discuss the application of this method to other frequencies and targets.},

Mars is further from the sun and therefore quite cold at its surface. Cylinders are subject to high radiation and puncture. We propose the third possibility of habitable mini-Earths that have a black hole core of sufficient size to retain an atmosphere and Earth-like gravity at the surface. The results of our investigation suggest that the ability of a mini-Earth to have Earth-like atmospheric conditions on the surface strongly depend on mass and size of such a habitat. The Earth-like surface conditions can be achieved in small-size habitats, with radius of ˂100 kilometers and with the relatively small mass black hole cores of \texttildelow 10 20 kg. Mass boosting also offers prospects for terraforming of existing objects, with sizes ranging within magnitude orders of 10-103 km. Future searches for biosignatures on Earth-like exoplanets might be able to detect Earth-like atmospheres on such objects.},

  abstract = {A new solution to the Fermi Paradox is presented: probes or visits from putative alien civilizations have a very low probability until a civilization reaches a certain age (called the Contact Era) after the onset of radio communications. If biotic planets are common, putative advanced civilizations may preferentially send probes to planets with technosignatures, such as radio broadcastings. The contact probability is defined as the chance to find a nearby civilization located close enough so that it could have detected the earliest radio emissions (the radiosphere) and sent a probe that would reach the Solar System at present. It is found that the current contact probability for Earth is very low unless civilizations are extremely abundant. Since the radiosphere expands with time, so does the contact probability. The Contact Era is defined as the time (since the onset of radio transmissions) at which the contact probability becomes of order unity. At that time alien probes (or messages) become more likely. Unless civilizations are highly abundant, the Contact Era is shown to be of the order of a few hundred to a few thousand years and may be applied not only to physical probes but also to transmissions (i.e. SETI). Consequently, it is shown that civilizations are unlikely to be able to inter-communicate unless their communicative lifetime is at least a few thousand years.},

  abstract = {Technosignatures refer to observational manifestations of technology that could be detected through astronomical means. Most previous searches for technosignatures have focused on searches for radio signals, but many current and future observing facilities could also constrain the prevalence of some non-radio technosignatures. This search could thus benefit from broader participation by the astronomical community, as contributions to technosignature science can also take the form of negative results that provide statistically meaningful quantitative upper limits on the presence of a signal. This paper provides a synthesis of the recommendations of the 2020 TechnoClimes workshop, which was an online event intended to develop a research agenda to prioritize and guide future theoretical and observational studies technosignatures. The paper provides a high-level overview of the use of current and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at ultraviolet, optical, or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on the detectability of atmospheric technosignatures, artificial surface modifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and interstellar flight. This overview does not derive any new quantitative detection limits but is intended to provide additional science justification for the use of current and planned observing facilities as well as to inspire astronomers conducting such observations to consider the relevance of their ongoing observations to technosignature science. This synthesis also identifies possible technology gaps with the ability of current and planned missions to search for technosignatures, which suggests the need to consider technosignature science cases in the design of future mission concepts. As a guide for astronomers new to the field of technosignature search (i.e. SETI), I present an overview of some of its observational and theoretical approaches. I review some of the various observational search strategies for SETI, focusing not on the variety of technosignatures that have been proposed or which are most likely to be found, but on the underlying philosophies that motivate searches for them. I cover passive versus active searches, ambiguous versus dispositive kinds of technosignatures, commensal or archival searches versus dedicated ones, communicative signals versus ``artifacts'', ``active'' versus derelict technologies, searches for beacons versus eavesdropping, and model-based versus anomaly-based searches. I also attempt to roughly map the landscape of technosignatures by kind and the scale over which they appear. I also discuss the importance of setting upper limits in SETI, and offer a heuristic for how to do so in a generic SETI search. I mention and attempt to dispel several misconceptions about the field. I conclude with some personal observations and recommendations for how to practice SETI, including how to choose good theory projects, how to work with experts and skeptics to improve one's search, and how to plan for success. A typical approach studied for the guidance of next generation space manipulators (satellites with robotic arms aimed at autonomously performing on-orbit operations) is to decouple the platform and the arm maneuvers, which are supposed to happen sequentially, mainly because of safety concerns. This control is implemented in this work as a two-stage Sequential control, where a first stage calls for the motion of the platform and the second stage calls for the motion of the manipulator. A second novel strategy is proposed, considering the platform and the manipulator as a single multibody system subject to a Coordinated control, with the goal of approaching and grasping a target spacecraft. At the scope, a region that the end effector can reach by means of the arm motion with limited reactions on the platform is identified (the so called Reaction Null workspace). The Coordinated control algorithm performs a gain modulation (finalized to a balanced contribution of the platform and arm motion) as a function of the target position within this Reaction Null map. The result is a coordinated maneuver in which the end effector moves thanks to the platform motion, predominant in a first phase, and to the arm motion, predominant when the Reaction-Null workspace is reached. In this way the collision avoidance and attitude over-control issues are automatically considered, without the need of splitting the mission in independent (and overall sub-optimal) segments. The guidance and control algorithms are first simulated by means of a multibody code, and successively tested in the lab by means of a free floating platform equipped with a robotic arm, moving frictionless on a flat granite table thanks to air bearings and on-off thrusters; the results will be discussed in terms of optimality of the fuel consumption and final accuracy. The effects of a radio-frequency (RF) power on the ion generation and electrostatic acceleration in a helicon electrostatic thruster were investigated with a constant discharge voltage of 300 V using argon as the working gas at a flow rate either of 0.5 Aeq (Ampere equivalent) or 1.0 Aeq. A RF power that was even smaller than a direct-current (DC) discharge power enhanced the ionization of the working gas, thereby both the ion beam current and energy were increased. However, an excessively high RF power input resulted in their saturation, leading to an unfavorable increase in an ionization cost with doubly charged ion production being accompanied. From the tradeoff between the ion production by the RF power and the electrostatic acceleration made by the direct current discharge power, the thrust efficiency has a maximum value at an optimal RF to DC discharge power ratio of 0.6 \textendash{} 1.0. This paper presents a novel non-certainty-equivalence adaptive control method for the attitude tracking control problem of spacecraft with inertia uncertainties. The proposed immersion and invariance (I\&I) based adaptation law provides a more direct and flexible approach to circumvent the limitations of the basic I\&I method without employing any filter signal. By virtue of the adaptation high-gain equivalence property derived from the proposed adaptive method, the closed-loop adaptive system with a low adaptation gain could recover the high adaptation gain performance of the filter-based I\&I method, and the resulting control torque demands during the initial transient has been significantly reduced. A special feature of this method is that the convergence of the parameter estimation error has been observably improved by utilizing an adaptation gain matrix instead of a single adaptation gain value. Numerical simulations are presented to highlight the various benefits of the proposed method compared with the certainty-equivalence-based control method and filter-based I\&I control schemes. Chaotic motion of the tethered towing of debris using a low-thrust tug is considered. Stable and unstable stationary solutions are presented for the in-plane motion of the system in a circular orbit, which depend on the value of the tug's thrust. The unstable solutions give rise to the chaotic motion of the system in the presence of additional disturbances. The chaotic behavior of the system, caused by the eccentricity of the orbit and out-of-orbital plane roll motion of the tether system, is investigated based on the equations of spatial motion of tethered satellites developed in previous works. It is shown that the chaotic motions of the system depend on the value of the tug's thrust, so that using the tug with low thrust and starting the active phase of the active debris removal from unsuitable initial conditions for the pitch and roll angles of the tether can lead to chaotic motion of the system. The concept of critically stable damping and its application to flexible structure control are presented. Critically stable damping was originally noted from the viewpoint of control-structure integration. It was recognized that a slight augmentation of structural damping would result in substantially more robust control without decreased performance and could guarantee the stability margin for any structural frequency increase. This paper illustrates the wide occurrence of critically stable damping phenomenon, establishes its basic relationship for the insight of the general design procedure, and applies the concept into the practical design of a satellite with a large deployable antenna. It is noted that the critically stable damping concept could provide a feasible approach to overcome the difficulty in ultra-large space structure design and control, and enhance the performance of a variety of excellent control design methodologies for flexible structure control. This critically stable damping provides new insight into the integrated design of control and structure. The space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is a new technology for air traffic management. The satellite equipped with spaceborne ADS-B system receives the broadcast signals from aircraft and transfers the message to ground stations, so as to extend the coverage area of terrestrial-based ADS-B. In this work, a novel satellite single-axis attitude determination solution based on the ADS-B receiving system is proposed. This solution utilizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurement of the broadcast signals from aircraft to determine the boresight orientation of the ADS-B receiving antenna fixed on the satellite. The basic principle of this solution is described. The feasibility study of this new attitude determination solution is implemented, including the link budget and the access analysis. On this basis, the nonlinear least squares estimation based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method is applied to estimate the single-axis orientation. A full digital simulation has been carried out to verify the effectiveness and performance of this solution. Finally, the corresponding results are processed and presented minutely.},

  abstract = {The intuition suggested by the Drake equation implies that technology should be less prevalent than biology in the galaxy. However, it has been appreciated for decades in the SETI community that technosignatures could be more abundant, longer-lived, more detectable, and less ambiguous than biosignatures. We collect the arguments for and against technosignatures' ubiquity and discuss the implications of some properties of technological life that fundamentally differ from nontechnological life in the context of modern astrobiology: It can spread among the stars to many sites, it can be more easily detected at large distances, and it can produce signs that are unambiguously technological. As an illustration in terms of the Drake equation, we consider two Drake-like equations, for technosignatures (calculating N (tech)) and biosignatures (calculating N (bio)). We argue that Earth and humanity may be poor guides to the longevity term L and that its maximum value could be very large, in that technology can outlive its creators and even its host star. We conclude that while the Drake equation implies that N (bio) {$\gg$} N (tech), it is also plausible that N (tech) {$\gg$} N (bio). As a consequence, as we seek possible indicators of extraterrestrial life, for instance, via characterization of the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, we should search for both biosignatures and technosignatures. This exercise also illustrates ways in which biosignature and technosignature searches can complement and supplement each other and how methods of technosignature search, including old ideas from SETI, can inform the search for biosignatures and life generally.},

  abstract = {I review the origins and development of the idea of Dyson spheres, their purpose, their engineering, and their detectability. I explicate the ways in which the popular imagining of them as monolithic objects would make them dynamically unstable under gravity and radiation pressure, and mechanically unstable to buckling. I develop a model for the radiative coupling between a star and large amounts of material orbiting it, and connect the observational features of a star plus Dyson sphere system to the gross radiative properties of the sphere itself. I discuss the still-unexplored problem of the effects of radiative feedback on the central star's structure and luminosity. Finally, I discuss the optimal sizes of Dyson spheres under various assumptions about their purpose as sources of low-entropy emission, dissipative work, or computation.},

  abstract = {We discuss the recent "realpolitik" analysis of Wisian \& Traphagan (2020) of the potential geopolitical fallout of the success of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). They conclude that "passive" SETI involves an underexplored yet significant risk. This is the risk that, in the event of a successful, passive detection of extraterrestrial technology, state-level actors could seek to gain an information monopoly on communications with an extraterrestrial intelligence. These attempts could lead to international conflict and potentially disastrous consequences. In response to this possibility, they argue that scientists and facilities engaged in SETI should preemptively engage in significant security protocols to forestall this risk. We find several flaws in their analysis. While we do not dispute that a realpolitik response is possible, we uncover concerns with Wisian \& Traphagan's presentation of the realpolitik paradigm, and we argue that sufficient reason is not given to justify treating this potential scenario as action-guiding over other candidate geopolitical responses. Furthermore, even if one assumes that a realpolitik response is the most relevant geopolitical response, we show that it is highly unlikely that a nation could successfully monopolize communication with ETI. Instead, the real threat that the authors identify is based on the perception by state actors that an information monopoly is likely. However, as we show, this perception is based on an overly narrow contact scenario. Overall, we critique Wisian \& Traphagan's argument and resulting recommendations on technical, political, and ethical grounds. Ultimately, we find that not only are Wisian and Traphagan's recommendations unlikely to work, they may also precipitate the very ills that they foresee. As an alternative to the Wisian \& Traphagan recommendations, we recommend transparency and data sharing (which are consistent with currently accepted best practices), further development of post-detection protocols, and better education of policymakers in this space.},

  abstract = {Many articulations of the Fermi Paradox have as a premise, implicitly or explicitly, that humanity has searched for signs of extraterrestrial radio transmissions and concluded that there are few or no obvious ones to be found. Tarter et al. and others have argued strongly to the contrary: bright and obvious radio beacons might be quite common in the sky, but we would not know it yet because our search completeness to date is so low, akin to having searched a drinking glass's worth of seawater for evidence of fish in all of Earth's oceans. Here, we develop the metaphor of the multidimensional ``Cosmic Haystack'' through which SETI hunts for alien ``needles'' into a quantitative, eight-dimensional model, and perform an analytic integral to compute the fraction of this haystack that several large radio SETI programs have collectively examined. Although this model haystack has many qualitative differences from the Tarter et al. haystack, we conclude that the fraction of it searched to date is also very small: similar to the ratio of the volume of a large hot tub or small swimming pool to that of the Earth's oceans. With this article, we provide a Python script to calculate haystack volumes for future searches and for similar haystacks with different boundaries. We hope this formalism will aid in the development of a common parameter space for the computation of upper limits and completeness fractions of search programs for radio and other technosignatures.},

  abstract = {One of the primary open questions of astrobiology is whether there is extant or extinct life elsewhere the solar system. Implicit in much of this work is that we are looking for microbial or, at best, unintelligent life, even though technological artefacts might be much easier to find. Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) work on searches for alien artefacts in the solar system typically presumes that such artefacts would be of extrasolar origin, even though life is known to have existed in the solar system, on Earth, for eons. But if a prior technological, perhaps spacefaring, species ever arose in the solar system, it might have produced artefacts or other technosignatures that have survived to present day, meaning solar system artefact SETI provides a potential path to resolving astrobiology's question. Here, I discuss the origins and possible locations for technosignatures of such a prior indigenous technological species, which might have arisen on ancient Earth or another body, such as a pre-greenhouse Venus or a wet Mars. In the case of Venus, the arrival of its global greenhouse and potential resurfacing might have erased all evidence of its existence on the Venusian surface. In the case of Earth, erosion and, ultimately, plate tectonics may have erased most such evidence if the species lived Gyr ago. Remaining indigenous technosignatures might be expected to be extremely old, limiting the places they might still be found to beneath the surfaces of Mars and the Moon, or in the outer solar system.},

  abstract = {The search for life in the universe is a major theme of astronomy and astrophysics for the next decade. Searches for technosignatures are complementary to searches for biosignatures, in that they offer an alternative path to discovery, and address the question of whether complex (i.e. technological) life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. This approach has been endorsed in prior Decadal Reviews and National Academies reports, and yet the field still receives almost no federal support in the US. Because of this lack of support, searches for technosignatures, precisely the part of the search of greatest public interest, suffers from a very small pool of trained practitioners. A major source of this issue is institutional inertia at NASA, which avoids the topic as a result of decades-past political grandstanding, conflation of the effort with non-scientific topics such as UFOs, and confusion regarding the scope of the term "SETI." The Astro2020 Decadal should address this issue by making developing the field an explicit priority for the next decade. It should recommend that NASA and the NSF support training and curricular development in the field in a way that supports equity and diversity, and make explicit calls for proposals to fund searches for technosignatures.},

We develop and evaluate our approach on spectrograms containing narrowband signals collected by Breakthrough Listen at the Green Bank telescope. The proposed approach is not meant to replace current narrowband searches but to demonstrate the potential to generalize to other signal types.},
