I welcome comments on my posts: the opportunity for immediate feedback is one of the main advantages of open research and one of the reasons I started this site.

I encourage criticism of my work - whether it is minor (typos) or major (my assumptions are not valid, my question is flawed, my code is broken, I misinterpreted my results, my plot does not make sense, etc.) and anything in between. I would rather know about any mistakes sooner rather than later so please feel free to point them out.

Suggestions for improvements or alternative approaches are always welcome.

Discussion is valuable.

Encouragement is always appreciated.

Personal attacks will ruin my day.

Please treat the comments section as if you were talking to me, and anyone else who might read your words, in person.

Using your real name would keep the comments in line with an open research philosophy, but you can comment anonymously if you prefer.

I review comments prior to publication and any that contain the following will be removed without exception:

- Rudeness
- Spam
- Trolling
